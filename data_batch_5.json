    "output": "Here’s a hydration plan for your 2-hour weightlifting session with millets:\n\n- **Plan**: Pre-lift (1 hour before): Drink 20 oz water with 1 cup ragi drink (ragi flour, water, lemon). During session: Sip 8 oz water with a pinch of rock salt every 20 minutes. Post-lift: Drink 20 oz tender coconut water with 1/2 cup cooked foxtail millet. (Approx. 150 kcal from ragi drink and millet)\n- **Why this works**: Ragi and foxtail millet provide sustained energy, while water and coconut water replenish electrolytes lost through sweat.\n\nTip: Keep a water bottle handy during your session, and monitor your hydration levels."
