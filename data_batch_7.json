    "output": "Here’s how alcohol can impact your weight loss diet:\n\n- **Cons**: Alcohol provides empty calories (7 kcal/g), so a 150 kcal glass of wine adds up quickly without satiety. It slows metabolism by prioritizing alcohol breakdown over fat burning, and it increases appetite, often leading to overeating. (Example: 1 beer = ~150 kcal, equivalent to a small snack but less filling.)\n\nTip: Limit to 1 drink (e.g., 5 oz wine) on occasional days, and pair with water to reduce cravings."
